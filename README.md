# Project Name
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein one have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 

## Table of Contents
* [General Information] : A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after Covid-19 to prepare themselves to cater to the people's demand and make profit.
  
* [Technologies Used]
  Python - version 3.9.7
  
 Packages used within Python with versions:

* [Conclusions]
  Specifically, the company want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
 Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
 How well those variables describe the bike demands?
